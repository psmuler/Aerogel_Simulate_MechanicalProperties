Movable Cellular Automata (MCA) method.
The procedure to prepare porous samples is based on random spheres method.
The resulting structures have densities in the range from 111 to 2200 kg/m3 and porosity up to 95%.
The structures of the samples are studied by obtaining the fractal dimension using the FD3 program.
The Young â€™s modulus is examined in the simulation of a compression test.

"The results prove that the Movable Cellular Automata method is suitable to investigate the mechanical properties of silica aerogels."
